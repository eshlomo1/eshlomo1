# Elli Shlomo  

**Microsoft MVP in Security • Security Research • Cloud & AI Security Specialist • DFIR**  

I’m a security researcher who lives at the intersection of offensive operations, cloud abuse, identity abuse, and enterprise defence.  
With a background in red-team tools, DFIR, threat hunting, cloud, and XDR (across M365, Azure, GCP, GWS), I enable defenders and testers to navigate the evolving threat terrain.

## 🤖 OffSec AI / AI Security Research  
The next wave of attack simulation isn’t human-only.  
I’m leading research into **Offensive AI (OffSec AI)** exploring how AI models, multi-agent systems, and orchestration frameworks can be exploited or hardened in real-world security contexts.  

Current work includes:  
- **AI Agent Exploitation**: understanding prompt injection, memory poisoning, model context protocol (MCP) weaknesses, and autonomous sub-agent control hijacking.  
- **AI-SOC Development**: building frameworks that integrate LLM-based agents into SOC pipelines for automated triage, detection engineering, and red teaming.  
- **PyRIT & MCP Experiments**: leveraging Microsoft’s PyRIT and custom evaluation pipelines to measure resilience against jailbreaks and prompt chaining attacks.  
- **AI-SPM (AI Security Posture Management)**: defining new detection layers for LLM-powered services inside Defender for Cloud and Sentinel.  

This research aims to close the gap between traditional threat modelling and AI-native attack surfaces.  
**Security by design is no longer optional, it’s survival.**
