**Microsoft Security MVP  • Security Research • Cloud & AI Security Specialist • DFIR**  
[![Microsoft MVP]([https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/media/learn/mvp/mvp-badge.svg](https://mvp.microsoft.com/Assets/UserProfile/MVP/Badge.svg))](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mvp)

I’m a security researcher who lives at the intersection of offensive operations, cloud abuse, identity abuse, and enterprise defence.  
With a background in red-team tools, DFIR, threat hunting, cloud, and XDR (across M365, Azure, GCP, GWS), I enable defenders and testers to navigate the evolving threat terrain.

## OffSec AI / AI Security Research  

I’m leading research into **Offensive AI (OffSec AI)** exploring how AI models, multi-agent systems, and orchestration frameworks can be exploited or hardened in real-world security contexts.  

Current work includes:  
- **AI Agent Exploitation**: understanding prompt injection, memory poisoning, model context protocol (MCP) weaknesses, and autonomous sub-agent control hijacking.  
- **AI-SOC Development**: building frameworks that integrate LLM-based agents into SOC pipelines for automated triage, detection engineering, and red teaming.  
- **PyRIT & MCP Experiments**: leveraging Microsoft’s PyRIT and custom evaluation pipelines to measure resilience against jailbreaks and prompt chaining attacks.  
- **AI-SPM (AI Security Posture Management)**: defining new detection layers for LLM-powered services inside Defender for Cloud and Sentinel.  

**Security by design is no longer optional, it’s survival.**
